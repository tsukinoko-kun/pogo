# Pogo

Centralized version control system with a workflow inspired by Jujutsu.

All repository data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.

It is not distributed like Git.

You don't push your changes to the central server, you just make your changes and Pogo will take care of the rest.

You can describe your changes before, during and after you made them.
By starting a new change, you commit your changes and make them immutable.
All changes are directly stored in the repository, so your team can use your changes right away.

## Install client

### From binary

Binary releases are available for Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install tsukinoko-kun/tap/pogo
```

### Scoop

```sh
scoop bucket add tsukinoko-kun https://github.com/tsukinoko-kun/scoop-bucket
scoop install pogo
```

### From source

CGO is optional for the client but recommended. When CGO is enabled, the original C-implementation of Zstd is used. Otherwise, a pure Go re-implementation (which is slower) is used.

You need Sqlc and Protoc (with the Go plugin) installed.

```sh
protoc --go_out=paths=source_relative:. protos/messages.proto
sqlc generate
go install ./bin/pogo/
```

## Server

ghcr.io/tsukinoko-kun/pogo

## Need to know

### SSH

SSH keys are used for authentication.
You need to set up your SSH agent properly and have a key pair to use Pogo.
You can set the public key to us with the `pogo config` command.
Verify that the key is detected by running `pogo whoami`.

On UNIX systems, make sure to set the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable to the path of your SSH agent socket.
On Windows, named pipes are used for OpenSSH agents.
